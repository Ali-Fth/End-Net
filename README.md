Neurological disorders affect the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Early detection is vital for better outcomes. Existing CNN models often focus on binary classification and perform poorly in multi-class tasks. This study proposes End-Net, a 24-layer CNN for early multi-class neurological disorder detection. It starts with 3 convolutional layers, followed by 21 optimized inception modules using parallel 1×1, 3×3, factorized 5×5 convolutions, and max pooling to capture fine and coarse features. This multi-branch setup extracts both local and global patterns, boosting generalization. End-Net also uses global average pooling and fully connected layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. Tested on the MCND dataset, it achieved 0.9540 accuracy, 0.9545 precision, 0.9533 recall, 0.9539 F1 score, 0.01 cross-entropy loss, and 0.0105 MSE.
