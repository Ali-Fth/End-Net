Neurological disorders comprise a broad spectrum of pathological conditions impacting the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the spinal cord, brain, and peripheral nerves. Early detection of these disorders is vital, significantly enhancing the five-year survival rate. Numerous deep CNN models have been proposed to classify neurological disorders using MRI scans. However, these models are typically designed for binary classification and may not effectively capture the multi-class features necessary for identifying subtle anatomical changes across various conditions. Additionally, they often experience a decrease in performance when classifying multiple classes. Therefore, this study introduces an early neurological disorder detection network (End-Net) for classifying neurological disorders. End-Net consists of 24 convolutional layers, beginning with a series of convolutional blocks, including three layers, followed by 21 layers of optimized inception modules to capture multi-scale features efficiently. These inception modules employ parallel convolutional branches with 1×1, 3×3, factorized 5×5 convolutions, and max pooling, enabling the model to extract fine-grained and coarse-grained features simultaneously. This multi-branch architecture enables the simultaneous extraction of both local detail features and global contextual patterns, enhancing its ability to generalize across diverse datasets. Furthermore, the model incorporates global average pooling and fully connected layers with dropout regularization to alleviate overfitting and improve robustness. The End-Net was evaluated on a developed Multi-Class Neurological Disorder (MCND) dataset and compared to established deep CNN models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms its competitors, achieving an accuracy of 0.9540, precision of 0.9545, recall of 0.9533, F1 score of 0.9539, cross-entropy loss of 0.01, and MSE of 0.0105 on the MCND dataset.
